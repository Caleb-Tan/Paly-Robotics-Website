Before projects start, he creates calendars and milestones for them along with ideal burndowns. He helps to develop methods to numerically track progress for their tasks and document the team’s progress. Finally, he ensures projects execute correctly by coordinating hours and deadlines. Jonathan was previously the programming team project manager, and is now the Zero Robotics captain, robot driver, and bike project lead. Outside of robotics, he enjoys playing baseball, reading about foreign policy, and programming.-"],

The design subteam is a newer subteam on this team, created in 2015 by Lydia, the first design captain. Design team focuses on making the concept of the robot. This process is split into four main phases: brainstorming and sketching, prototyping, CADing, and part drawings. After the design team finishes the design of the robot, the part drawings are handed off to build team to manufacture the robot."],

When not holding serious meetings at Tin Pot or Kirk’s with the Art Team Leadership, she spends her time doing odd-jobs for Paly Theatre and her APUSH homework. And yes, it is very funny that her name is Maya and the Art Team uses Autodesk Maya. In fact, it's so funny that you should definitely make that joke to her face for the 9,999th time, because it hasn’t gotten old by now at all. Ha. Ha. Ha.+"],

While on business, Shota helped find sponsors, and his hard work helped find the team food sponsors for build season. In addition, he was the lead for the Spirit and Stanford Concessions committees. As the year progressed, he found himself helping and organizing scouting and strategy at competitions, cage reorganization in the offseason and the PALY Robotics summer camp.
